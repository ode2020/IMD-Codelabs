1. **Final Project: Visit Rwanda App**

Visit Rwanda App will be a CRUD Application will be developed for my country's tourism department owned by Rwanda Development Board (RDB).
The Visit Rwanda App will be very useful to both the country and tourista who day to day need access to all tourism related information in an easy way.<br>
Currently there is a website for tourism but there is no mobile app. <br> To develop this Application I will use Java on Android Studio IDE. <br>

1.1. **Features** <br>
The following are some of the features of the Visit Rwanda App: <br>
- Authenticate users through Sin Up and Sign In
- View various touristic areas and urban areas 
- Select an arear and do booking
- Offer to the user the ability to make some changes to his/her booking if needed
- Offer to the user the ability to delete/cancel his/her booking
- Display the delete alert to the user before deleting the booking information
- Offer to the user the ability to make payment(Future work)

### Week 3. Layouts and Resources for UI
. Codelab 1.2.PartA: My first interactive UI <br>
>This codelab aims to create a HelloToast App in a portrait setting. The app consists of two Buttons and one TextView, wherebyif the user taps the first button, it displays a short message (Toast) on the screen. <br> Tapping the secong Button increases the (click) counter displayed in the TextView starting from zero. <br>. UI elements have been constrained in order to have a nice design as shown on the screenshot above.
